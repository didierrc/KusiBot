            <p class="lead text-center mb-4">
                KusiBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to offer a supportive space for discussing mental well-being and provide initial mental health assessments.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was developed as a <strong>Final Degree Project</strong> with the goal of exploring how AI, specifically Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), can be applied in the mental health domain. It aims to serve users seeking a company to talk to in those rough times as well as giving preliminary assessments.

            <h2 class="h4">How KusiBot Works</h2>
            <p>
                KusiBot operates using a Multi-Agent System architecture:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manager Agent:</strong>Orchestrates your input messages routing it to the specific agent.</li>
                <li><strong>Intent Recogniser Agent:</strong>Understands your input using BERT - an AI language model - to determine the intent behind your messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Conversation Agent:</strong>Handles the general flow of conversation, making the interaction feel natural, powered by Mistral 7B (a Large Language Model - LLM).</li>
                <li><strong>Assessment Agent:</strong>Administers standardised mental health questionnaires when a warning intent is detected, currently including the <strong>PHQ-9 (for Depression)</strong> and <strong>GAD-7 (for Anxiety)</strong>, guiding you through the questions to assess you so other professionals can check out your status.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This approach allows KusiBot to manage different aspects of the conversation effectively, from casual chat to structured assessment.
